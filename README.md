How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

We can ensure code, program, or software is functional and secure through testing. 
The two main types of testing are static and dynamic tests. 
There are many sub-categories of each. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Developers must gather requirement data from the business and end users. The 
team should create models of the system to understand the functionality before even
beginning to write it. Through static and dynamic testing, we can create manual and 
automated tests to verify the requirements and functionality.

How do I approach designing software?

The first thing to remember is to keep code as simplified and orderly as possible. 
Testing and troubleshooting messy code leads to more errors and can take a lot of
time to maintain and repair. The next item is to focus on requirements and what the 
system is intended to do. This notion will contribute greatly to creating simplified 
code. By the same notion, testing and automation can be created and utilized more 
easily. Each of the steps go hand in hand in order to create an application, program, 
or software that is efficient and effective.
